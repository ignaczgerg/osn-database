    <h2>What is Organic Solvent Nanofiltration?</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 160%">
      Organic Solvent Nanofiltration (OSN) or Solvent Resistant Nanofiltration
      (SRNF) is a pressure-driven membrane separation technology that is capable
      of distinguishing and separating solutes based on the physicochemical
      parameters. OSN offers a low-energy and continuous tool with extensive use
      in the pharmaceutical, food, and fine chemical industry. 
      <br></br>
      OSN has been primarily used in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries [1], 
      solute recovery [2, 3], solvent recycling [4], and purification [5]. In addition,
      OSN is considered a green and potentially sustainable separation technology
      due to its low energy consumption and waste generation.

    <h2 >Why do we need a database?</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 160%">
        Having a collection of scientific data would facilitate the development of 
        membrane technology and their closely connected fields, such as chemistry and 
        material science.
