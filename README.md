# OSN-DATABASE
The OSN Database can be accessed through www.osndatabase.com (with all its amazing functionalities)!
OSN Database is the first repository for organic solvent membrane separation data first published in September 2021. 
Our aim is to provide high quality data and online tools to the membrane community.
